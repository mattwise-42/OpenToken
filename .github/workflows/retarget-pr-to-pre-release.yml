            **Why?** Feature branches and standard development work should target \`pre-release\`, not \`main\`.
            
            **The \`main\` branch** is reserved for release PRs from \`release/*\` branches only.
            
            If you believe this PR should target \`main\` (e.g., it's a hotfix or release), please:
            1. Create a \`release/x.y.z\` branch
            2. Open a new PR from that branch to \`main\`
            
            For more information, see our [contributing guidelines](.github/pull_request_template.md).`
